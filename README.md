# You want to code shadergif ?

Need help setting up a dev machine? You can contact me on twitter @antoineMoPa / tumblr ( dontcode.tumblr.com ) / whatever social network where you find me.

I guess the first step is to setup a server in a virtual machine, or on your computer if you run Linux like me:

I have a virtualbox exported virtual machine that you could use, contact me to have a download link. (I did not upload it anywhere yet since it is 1.8GB) I'll be happy to send the VM to any (possible) contributor.
